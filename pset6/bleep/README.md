NOTE:

The program is incomplete as I get this errors from CS50 check:

:( input of 'THIS DARN WORLD' outputs 'THIS **** WORLD'
expected "THIS **** WORLD...", not "THIS DARN WORLD..."

:( handles banned words lists with arbitrary words in them
expected "My *** and *** ...", not "My cat and dog ..."
